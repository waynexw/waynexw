Hi, Iâ€™m Wayne. My research interests include simulation-based performance evaluation and optimization of buildings energy conservation, Algorithm Optimization, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Intelligent Automation, Energy-efficient Systems, Intelligent Transportation Systems and so on.

Of particular recent work, our AI Team is focusing on simulation-based performance evaluation and optimization of building energy efficiency via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our Program Team is focusing on the research of Swagger and the amalgamation tech of online streaming media.
